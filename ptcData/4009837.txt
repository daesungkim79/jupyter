Object Text: 1. ApplCom and ApplComIf shall exchange the data between them via one global variable as struct data type (g_tApplComData).
2. This global variable shall have subset of structures that contains Message layout with physical signal values matching to the DBC
	*. Example code is given below
		*. ApplCom_T g_tApplCom_Data
		*. typedef struct
{ 
        RX_MSG_LIST rxMsg;
        TX_MSG_LIST txMsg;
}ApplCom_T;
	
		*. 

typedef struct 
{
         RX_EBCM_MSG_1   EBCM_Msg_1;
         RX_VICM_MSG_1 VICM_Msg_1;
}RX_MSG_LIST;	
		*. 

typedef struct
{
          MSG_CFG                                   Cfg;
          RX_MSG_INFO                           Info;
          MSG_LAYOUT_EBCM_MSG_1  Layout;
          uint8                                             RxIpdu[VICM_Msg_1_LENGTH];
} RX_EBCM_MSG_1;	
		*. 

typedef struct 
{
           uint8  u8PduId;
           uint8  u8DataId[2];
           uint8  u8Length;
}MSG_CFG;	
		*. 

typedef struct
{
            uint8 u8NewMsgRecv;
            uint8 u8RxAtleastOnce;
            uint8 u8MsgTimeoutFlg;
            uint8 u8MsgArcFailFlg;
            uint8 u8MsgCrcFailFlg;
}RX_MSG_INFO;	
		*. 

typedef struct
{
            uint8 u8EBCM_Sig1;
            uint8 u8EBCM_Sig2;
            float32 f32EBCM_Sig3;
}MSG_LAYOUT_EBCM_MSG_1;	
3. For Rx messages, ApplCom periodic runnable shall check if a new message is received for a particular PDU ID that is configured in CanIf module.
4. If a new message is received, ApplCom shall get updated Pdu buffer data (raw data) via CanIf_Callouts.c callback functions and convert the raw data into physical signal and update the Rx message layout signal variable (g_tApplCom_Data) with this physical data. ApplComIf shall then update the Rte P-ports with this physical signal information in its own periodic runnable.
5. For Tx messages, ApplComIf periodic runnable shall update the physical signal of the Tx message based on the data received from other SWCs via Rte-R ports.
6. ApplCom shall convert this physical data into raw data and update the PDU buffer in its own periodic runnable (after confirming the ACK was received for the previous Tx message) and then trigger CAN Tx by calling the callback function defined in CanIf_Callouts.c
