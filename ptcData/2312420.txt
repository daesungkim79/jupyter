Internal Review Comment: 20.02.11
Software Component Specification Index 및 traceability 대상 항목 Review 진행
1) Traceability는 1항 Specification 하위에 Design specification으로 확보
2) 1항 Specification내 Design specification에서는 활용 가능한 column field를 최대한 활용 (Feature, ASIL, Resource, Limitation)
3) 2항 Functional Description은 runnable level로 design을 서술하되 항목의 Category는 HW/SW design specification이 아닌 comment로 하여 traceability에 의한 burden이 생기지 않도록 하면서 Unit designer에게 충분한 정보를 제공하도록 함
4) 4항 Interfaces항 내 ArrayConstant table에 Category를 삽입하여 array와 map을 구분
