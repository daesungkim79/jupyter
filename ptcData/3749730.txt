Object Text: 1. ApplComIf and ApplComSigProcess shall exchange the data between them via one global variable as struct data type (ApplComSigProcess).
2. This global structure variable shall have subset of structures (based on the function) that contains inputs and outputs. For example, lets say ApplComSigProcess.c has a function that compares two VehSpd sources and outputs the average VehSpd and validity of the VehSpd. The inputs to this function is VehSpd1, VehSpd2 and the outputs of this function would be VehSpd and VehSpdVld.
3. ApplComIf updates the inputs VehSpd1 and VehSpd2 via Rte_Read_xx from other SWCs and then calls the ApplComSigProcess function.
4. ApplComSigProcess returns the output, which shall be used by ApplComIf to upate Rte_Write_xx buffer.
5. Example code is give below.  
	*. /***********************************
Structure definition example
************************************/
APPLCOM_SIG_PROCESS ApplComSigProcess;

	
	*. typedef struct{
   VEHSPD_COMP VehSpdCmp;
   WHLSPD_COMP WhlSpdCmp;
}APPLCOM_SIG_PROCESS;

	
	*. typedef struct{
    INPUT_VEHSPD_COMP       in;
    OUTPUT_VEHSPD_COMP   out;
}VEHSPD_COMP;	
	*. 

typedef struct{
    uint8   u8VehSpd1;
    uint8   u8VehSpd2;
}INPUT_VEHSPD_COMP;

	
	*. typedef struct{
    uint8 u8VehSpd;
    uint8 u8VehSpdVld
}OUTPUT_VEHSPD_COMP;
/***********************************
Function call example
************************************/
void pr1ApplComIf_VehSpdLogic(void)
{
       ApplComSigProcess.VehSpdCmp.in.u8VehSpd1 = Rte_Read_xx();
       ApplComSigProcess.VehSpdCmp.in.u8VehSpd2 = Rte_Read_xx();
 
       ApplComSigProcess_VehSpdLogic(ApplComSigProcess.VehSpdCmp.in, &ApplComSigProcess.VehSpdCmp.out)
 
       Rte_Write_xx(ApplComSigProcess.VehSpdCmp.out.u8VehSpd);
       Rte_Write_xx(ApplComSigProcess.VehSpdCmp.out.u8VehSpdVld);
}
